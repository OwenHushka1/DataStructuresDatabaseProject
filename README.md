# DataStructuresDatabaseProject
The objective of this project is to write an application that reads a list of University courses from a data file and then inserts them into two separate hash tables. The first hash table will use the Open Addressing collision resolution scheme and the second hash table will use the Chaining collision resolution scheme.
